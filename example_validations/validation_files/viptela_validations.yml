# Information
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## The validation file is structured by feature and then within the feature the sub-features that will be validated
## Both features and sub-features are optional, you don't have to define all features or all sub-features within a feature
### Strict: Any validation that is strict means it must be an exact match, no more, no less. Applies to lists or dictionaries of things such as OSPF neighbors or BGP peers
### Integers: Numerical values can be an exact match (must be an integer), less than a value ("<15"), more than a value (">15"), between a range ("10<->20") or tolerance percentage either side of a value ("10%15")
